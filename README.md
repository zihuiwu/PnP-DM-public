# Code for "Principled Probabilistic Imaging using Diffusion Models as Plug-and-Play Priors" (NeurIPS 2024)

### 1) Install packages
```python
conda create -n pnpdm python=3.10
conda activate pnpdm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2) Download pretrained checkpoint

Download the corresponding checkpoint from the links below and move it to ```./models/```.
 - [FFHQ (color)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jElnRoFv7b31fG0v6pTSQkelbSX3xGZh?usp=sharing)
 - [FFHQ (grayscale)](https://caltech.box.com/s/6317csam14z1df3ktlorenf9njvuyp44)
 - [Blackhole (grayscale)](https://caltech.box.com/s/o5biomi9juqmwmvjvwb8z17l6cc8xatm)

### 4) Modify the dataset and model paths in config files
You need to modify the paths in the following files so that the dataset and models can be loaded properly:
 - `./configs/data/ffhq.yaml`
 - `./configs/data/ffhq_grayscale.yaml`
 - `./configs/model/edm_unet_adm_blackhole.yaml`
 - `./configs/model/edm_unet_adm_dps_ffhq.yaml`
 - `./configs/model/edm_unet_adm_gray_ffhq.yaml`

### 4) Run experiments
All the commands for running our experiments are provided in ```commands.sh```.
The experiments are configured using [hydra](https://hydra.cc/). 
Please see its documentation for detailed usage.
